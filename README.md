# Fraud-Detetcion

In this project I worked with the [banknote authentication data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication) provided by [UCI's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) as well as a [fraud detection bank data set](https://www.kaggle.com/volodymyrgavrysh/fraud-detection-bank-dataset-20k-records-binary). My goal was to use quantum machine learning to do classification on both of these data sets.
